In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and built a predictive models to understand and predict horse colic outcomes using a dataset containing various features about horses, their medical conditions, and treatment details. Dataset was obtained from Kaggle. Horse colic refers to abdominal pain, which can be a life-threatening condition for horses. Early prediction is crucial for successful treatment.

In this project, I explored the dataset using EDA techniques., cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure it's suitable for modeling. Machine learning models were built to predict the outcome of colic.
The dataset used for the analysis contained various features related to horse health and treatments, including: Age, clinical signs observed (e.g., symptoms related to colic),surgical treatments received (yes/no),outcome of the condition (survived, euthanized or died), etc

For model evaluation, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score were used to evaluate model performance.
The best-performing model was selected to predict colic outcomes and provide insights.

Key Insights:
Adult horses had more colic cases compared to young horses
Certain clinical signs were strongly correlated with higher mortality rates.
Surgery, when needed, significantly increased the chances of survival.
Age played crucial roles in predicting the survival outcome.
Horses whose conditions did not require surgery often survived signifying such cases were not complicated compared to horses that required surgery.

Takeaways: This analysis highlights how machine learning can be applied in veterinary medicine to predict critical health outcomes for animals, ultimately aiding in timely interventions. The ability to predict the likelihood of survival in colic cases can help veterinarians make more informed decisions about treatment options.
